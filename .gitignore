# pyenv
#   For a library or tool, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, to ensure the environment is exactly reproduced, you should recreate the virtualenv from
#   the lock file rather than the Pipfile:
#     $ pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
